In this exercise you\u2019ll apply the basics of functional and parallel programming. \n\nLet\u2019s start with a simple example. Let\u2019s consider you have a list of integers.\n\nLet\u2019s find out what the size of this list is.\n\nNote that we already provide an RDD object, so please have a look at the RDD API in order to find out what function to use:\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD\n\nThe following link contains additional documentation:\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This notebook is designed to run in a IBM Watson Studio default runtime (NOT the Watson Studio Apache Spark Runtime as the default runtime with 1 vCPU is free of charge). Therefore, we install Apache Spark in local mode for test purposes only. Please don't use it in production.\n\nIn case you are facing issues, please read the following two documents first:\n\nhttps://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/Environment-Setup\n\nhttps://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/FAQ\n\nThen, please feel free to ask:\n\nhttps://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-big-data-apache-spark/discussions/all\n\nPlease make sure to follow the guidelines before asking a question:\n\nhttps://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/FAQ#im-feeling-lost-and-confused-please-help-me\n\n\nIf running outside Watson Studio, this should work as well. In case you are running in an Apache Spark context outside Watson Studio, please remove the Apache Spark setup in the first notebook cells."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from IPython.display import Markdown, display\ndef printmd(string):\n    display(Markdown('# <span style=\"color:red\">'+string+'</span>'))\n\n\nif ('sc' in locals() or 'sc' in globals()):\n    printmd('<<<<<!!!!!
